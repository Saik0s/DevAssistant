# DevAssistant (WIP)

## Components:

- Perception module: This module is responsible for processing raw data from different sources and extracting relevant features. It could use techniques like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
- Memory module: This module is responsible for managing different types of memory, such as short-term, long-term, and procedural memory. It should allow efficient storage, retrieval, and updating of information.
- Learning module: This module is responsible for updating the AGI's knowledge and improving its performance over time. It could use techniques like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.
- Reasoning module: This module is responsible for making decisions, solving problems, and generating new tasks based on the given objective. It should be capable of handling complex reasoning tasks and making inferences from available data.
- Execution module: This module is responsible for carrying out the tasks generated by the reasoning module. It should have the ability to interact with external systems and perform actions autonomously.
- Communication module: This module is responsible for interacting with humans and other AI systems. It should support natural language understanding and generation, as well as other communication modalities.

## Workflow:

1. Receive the objective as input.
2. Pre-process the objective using the perception module to extract relevant features.
3. Use the reasoning module to decompose the objective into smaller sub-goals and tasks.
4. Prioritize tasks and sub-goals based on the AGI's understanding of the problem and the available resources.
5. Execute tasks using the execution module, updating the memory module with the results.
6. Monitor progress towards the objective and evaluate the performance using the learning module.
7. If the objective is not yet achieved, adjust the approach based on the learning module's feedback and generate new tasks.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the objective is achieved or a stopping condition is reached.
9. Communicate the results and any relevant insights to the user or other AI systems using the communication module.
